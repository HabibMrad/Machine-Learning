# Machine Learning

Repository containing various codes and notes related to Machine Learning, Statistics, Data Science, Deep Learning.

## Current codes include:

- Module for preprocessing data and creating Pandas dataframes from xml hierarchical data
- Stemmed/Lemmatized Vectorizers (extension of sklearn's HashedVectorizer) suited for transforming sentences into their sparse bag of words representations
- Gradient optimization algorithms (Gradient Descent, SGD, momentum, nesterov, adagrad, rmsprop, adam, adamax, nadam)
- Solutions to AndrewNG's Machine Learning Coursera course in highly vectorized fashion
- Jupyter notebook with gambler's game implementation
- Jupyter notebooks with exercises regarding Natural Language Processing

## Current mind map notes include (created via XMind):

- deeplearningbook (first 9 chapters)
- Notes from AndrewNG's course (mentioned above) (in Polish)
- Notes from 'Machine Learning Probabilistic Perspective' by Kevin P. Murphy (chapter 2,3,4)
- Mind maps from frameworks, e.g.:
  - Tensorflow
  - sklearn
  - seaborn
  - spaCy
  - nltk
